# Portfolio Pacman

This is my personal porfolio. See the live version [here](https://devpaezrubio.com).

It combines an actual playable [Pac-Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-Man) with the usual information found in a portfolio.

It's built with [pixi.js](https://github.com/pixijs/pixijs) and [@vue/reactivity](https://github.com/vuejs/core/tree/main/packages/reactivity) (not the complete Vue framework, but just the reactivity library).
